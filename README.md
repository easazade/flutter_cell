# Flutter Cell

configurable architectural components that makes state management and writing logic a breeze for your flutter app

## What is flutter_cell

think about `Bloc`. it's just a simple pattern used for state-management, which you use it as a component of your app to manage the state of your pages. now think of `flutter_cell` as a set of components that one of it's components is for state management like Bloc but it is called `Cell`. `Cell` is simpler to use and gives us more functionality because it is well integrated with other components of the `flutter_cell` library like `Screen`. yes like I said `flutter_cell` is not just one state management component. it is a set of components. and each component will give you more juice to write better, more readable with less WTF code. and not only that, when these components are used together they will give you even more functionlaity

## Why use Flutter Cell?

- **It's configurable :** 
in flutter_cell we provide lots of features and functionlaities like dependency injection for the components, dialogs, toast messages, checking netowrk conenction and etc. but the things is these functionalities are all configurable. as a matter of fact. some of these functionlaities won't work until you configure them (which is simple).

- **Lots of features and functionalities :**
one of the goals of flutter_cell is to eliminate lots of cumbersome stuff that we all have to deal with no matter which state management library we use. in flutter_cell is designed to be a set of components that are well integrated together with the purpose of handling lots of stuff for you, with a single command.

- **You don't have to use all the components :**
in flutter_cell you don't have to use all the components if you just want to use state management component `Cell` and ditch the `Screen` component you can completely do that.
